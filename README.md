# Transformer Sandbox

A Python project for experimenting with transformer models, featuring a simple implementation of the Transformer architecture and training utilities.
Below, is an animated GIF showing the model's progress over several training examples, for both char-level and word-level tokens:

![Training Progress](animation_token.gif)
![Training Progress](animation_word.gif)

**What you'll see:**
- **Loss curves** (blue) and **validation loss** (red) decreasing over time
- **Accuracy curves** showing training and validation performance
- **Text samples** generated at each checkpoint using a custom input prompt

The GIF is automatically generated after training completes, showing the complete learning journey from random characters to Shakespeare-like patterns!

## Visualization
The model's word embeddings can be visualized to understand how it represents relationships between words. Below is a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) visualization of word embeddings for a sample sentence prediction task:

![Word Embeddings PCA](embedding.png)

The plot above shows the 2D projection of word embeddings for the sentence "Juliet carried Romeo __". Each point represents a word, with similar words clustering together in the embedding space. This visualization helps us understand how the model learns to represent semantic relationships between words during training.

Key observations:
- Related words (like character names) tend to cluster together
- Words with similar grammatical roles show proximity
- The model learns meaningful vector representations that capture both semantic and syntactic relationships

## Usage

### ðŸŽ­ Shakespeare Demo - The Main Attraction

The centerpiece of this project is `demos/Demo Shakespeare.ipynb`, a comprehensive tutorial that demonstrates the full transformer training pipeline:

```bash
cd demos
jupyter notebook "Demo Shakespeare.ipynb"
```

#### What You'll Learn

This interactive notebook walks you through:

1. **Environment Setup**: Automatic device detection (MPS/CPU) and module imports
2. **Data Processing**: Loading Shakespeare text, creating vocabulary, and encoding/decoding functions
3. **Model Architecture**: Building a custom transformer with configurable parameters
4. **Training Process**: Complete training loop with real-time metrics and validation
5. **Visualization**: Training loss/accuracy plots for model analysis
6. **Text Generation**: Creating new Shakespeare-style text from custom prompts

#### Demo Features

- **Character-level generation** for fine-grained text control
- **Interactive training** with progress bars and real-time metrics
- **Customizable prompts** - try your own Shakespeare-style openings
- **Performance optimization** for Apple Silicon Macs
- **Educational explanations** for each step of the process

#### Sample Output

The demo generates text like:
```
Input: "OMELETTE. To fry, or not to fry?"
Output: "TOETHYOSUIW. Ss AXd po, Path phit ive? Y. TSNDHO..."
```

While not necessarily legible, it captures some trends like punctuation and capitalizing names!

### Using the Components Separately

#### Creating a Transformer Model

```python
from networks import Transformer

# Create a transformer with custom parameters
model = Transformer(
    vocab_size=1000,
    embedding_size=32,
    num_heads=3,
    num_layers=1,
    block_size=50,
    dropout=0.1
)
```

#### Training with the Runner

```python
from runners import Runner
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Setup training components
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
runner = Runner(model, loss_fn, optimizer, device="cpu")

# Train the model
runner.train(train_data, val_data, batch_size=64, iters=1000)
```

#### Text Generation

```python
# Generate text continuation
generated_text = runner.generate(
    string_input="To be or not to be",
    encode=encode_function,
    decode=decode_function,
    max_new_tokens=50
)
```
