# Transformer Sandbox

A Python project for experimenting with transformer models, featuring a simple implementation of the Transformer architecture and training utilities.

## ðŸŽ¬ Training Visualization Demo

Watch the transformer learn in real-time! The training process generates an animated GIF showing the model's progress:

![Training Progress](animation.gif)

**What you'll see:**
- **Loss curves** (blue) and **validation loss** (red) decreasing over time
- **Accuracy curves** showing training and validation performance
- **Text samples** generated at each checkpoint using the prompt "HAMLET\n To be, or not to be?"

The GIF is automatically generated after training completes, showing the complete learning journey from random characters to Shakespeare-like patterns!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd transformer-sandbox
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Verify installation:
```bash
python test.py
```

## Usage

### ðŸŽ­ Shakespeare Demo - The Main Attraction

The centerpiece of this project is `demos/Demo Shakespeare.ipynb`, a comprehensive tutorial that demonstrates the full transformer training pipeline:

```bash
cd demos
jupyter notebook "Demo Shakespeare.ipynb"
```

#### What You'll Learn

This interactive notebook walks you through:

1. **Environment Setup**: Automatic device detection (MPS/CPU) and module imports
2. **Data Processing**: Loading Shakespeare text, creating vocabulary, and encoding/decoding functions
3. **Model Architecture**: Building a custom transformer with configurable parameters
4. **Training Process**: Complete training loop with real-time metrics and validation
5. **Visualization**: Training loss/accuracy plots for model analysis
6. **Text Generation**: Creating new Shakespeare-style text from custom prompts

#### Demo Features

- **Character-level generation** for fine-grained text control
- **Interactive training** with progress bars and real-time metrics
- **Customizable prompts** - try your own Shakespeare-style openings
- **Performance optimization** for Apple Silicon Macs
- **Educational explanations** for each step of the process

#### Sample Output

The demo generates text like:
```
Input: "OMELETTE. To fry, or not to fry?"
Output: "TOETHYOSUIW. Ss AXd po, Path phit ive? Y. TSNDHO..."
```

While not perfect English, it captures Shakespeare's linguistic patterns and structure!

### Using the Components Separately

#### Creating a Transformer Model

```python
from networks import Transformer

# Create a transformer with custom parameters
model = Transformer(
    vocab_size=1000,
    embedding_size=32,
    num_heads=3,
    num_layers=1,
    block_size=50,
    dropout=0.1
)
```

#### Training with the Runner

```python
from runners import Runner
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Setup training components
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
runner = Runner(model, loss_fn, optimizer, device="cpu")

# Train the model
runner.train(train_data, val_data, batch_size=64, iters=1000)
```

#### Text Generation

```python
# Generate text continuation
generated_text = runner.generate(
    string_input="To be or not to be",
    encode=encode_function,
    decode=decode_function,
    max_new_tokens=50
)
```

## Model Architecture

The transformer implementation includes:
- **Multi-head self-attention** with configurable number of heads
- **Position-wise feed-forward networks**
- **Layer normalization** and **residual connections**
- **Configurable embedding dimensions** and **number of layers**
- **Dropout** for regularization

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter (for running demos)

See `requirements.txt` for specific package versions.
